## Basic Usage

To create a new package using composer, use the following command:

```BASH
composer create-project brightnucleus/boilerplate <package-folder>
```

This will create a new folder called `<package-folder>`, clone the `brightnucleus/boilerplate` package into that folder, and run the setup scripts. These scripts will ask you several questions about the package you want to create.
